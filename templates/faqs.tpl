<h2>iSchedule247 FAQs</h2>
<p> <b>1. Do my contacts have to pay anything to send them reminders from iSchedule247?</b><p>
No and they don't have to be subscribers either. We also presume if they are receiving text/SMS 
reminders that they typically have the "all you can eat" text/SMS plans (Mobile support is U.S. 
based at this time).
</p>
<p><b>2. Why should I choose iSchedule247.com?</b><p>
<ul>
<li>There's a basic forever-<a href= "../signup"><b>free</b></a> version. 
<li>You don't have to download anything. 
<li>It's very easy to access and very effective in managing multiple calendars with events. 
<li>It's really simple to use.
<li>The <a href= "../upgrade"><b>$29.95 version</b> </a> is still a very transparent cost if you need more. 
<li>Oh, and you can automatically remind your group of their events. Set it and forget it!
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>3. Why is the upgraded version not immediately available after purchase?</b><p>
At this stage, it will take up to 8-24 hours at the very most. When Paypal sends us a payment 
confirmation, we do a manual verfication system check, then activate and inform you within that time
frame or earlier. Some of this is e-commerce security paranoia on our part at this stage.
</p>
<p><b>4. Why the character use limitations for the reminders?</b><p>
We're following the 160 character model and it provides us some key flexibility.
</p>
<p><b>5. What is the difference between the free and paid version?</b></p>
We feel one free calendar with 10 events and 10 contacts is fair and still very useful. The annual 
$29.95 cost ups this by 5 fold and we feel it's a great value at a very nominal price. Also, we're
considering potential spam thresholds. <a href="mailto:vsales@ischedule247.com?subject=iSchedule247

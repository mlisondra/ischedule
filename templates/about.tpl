<h2>About iSchedule247 </h2>
<p> We're a couple friends and developers from the Silicon Valley, with what we think, are very 
similar, busy family lives and activities as you. We developed this originally just for
our personal use and have since put it out for the world to use. We really feel there
is simple but great value in iSchedule247.com in what it does.
</p>
<p>
The genesis of iSchedule247.com came from all those moms, carpool parents, sports team 
managers, office managers, and the like, who dedicatedly organize many calendars of events. 
iSchedule247.com intends to do it all very easily and beautifully, PLUS it provides the ability 
to remind all those involved of their events automatically to their email and or mobile devices. 
It is basically an easy, centralized way to handle one or more calendars in one place AND 
automatically send out reminders to anyone from your group.

<p>
iSchedule247.com makes it really user-friendly. From accessing your calendars quickly, easily 
visualizing calendars and events and automatically sending out reminders and notifications to anyone, 
iSchedule247.com will absolutely help organize the events in your life, your family, your sports

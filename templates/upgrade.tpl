<h2>Why Upgrade?</h2>
<p>Why should you upgrade from your free iSchedule247 account to the full version? 
	<ul>
		<li>More calendar categories to separate out more event types to support more groups. </li>
		<li>More contacts can be supported to inform more people and more groups</li>
		<li>And it's cheaper and easier than anything else on the market!</li>
	</ul>
	<p> You will be taken to PayPal's trusted, secure site for the credit card processing. <u><em>iSchedule247.com
	will receive a confirmation and it will take 8-24 hours at most to activate your upgraded account.</em></u> Also
	iSchedule247.com never holds your financial information - only verification from PayPal that you subscribed
	or are a current subscriber.</p>
	<p>Currently, we feel this is the safest and most objective transaction agent for this service. 
	<em>If  you don't have a PayPal account, you'll see at the bottom of the Paypal payment page 
	that an account will be easily made when you enter your credit card information. </em></p>
